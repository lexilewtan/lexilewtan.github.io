*Hey, I'm Lexi.* I used to work at betaworks, and before that I worked on Techstars, Contently, Lore, Savored and NYLON. I also am an alumni of Tech@NYU, and I've been connecting people and ideas for as long as I can remember. 

Right now, I'm working on Hired, the easiest, most transparent marketplace for hiring top tech talent. If you are an engineer, designer or product manager looking for a job, you should check it out&mdash;and if you're an employer looking to hire, you should get in touch.
