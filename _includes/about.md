*Hey, I'm Lexi.* I currently launch new markets for [Hired](https://hired.com/). I used to work for [betaworks](http://betaworks.com/), and before that I worked at [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com/), [Contently](https://contently.com/), [Lore](http://lore.com/), [Savored](http://savored.com/) and [NYLON](http://nylonmag.com/). I also am an alumni of [Tech@NYU](http://techatnyu.org/).
