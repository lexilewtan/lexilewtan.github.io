*I am an optimistic, easily intrigued connector of people, companies, and ideas.* 

I love a good pair of headphones, intense discussion and anything with avocado on it.

I currently work at [Hired](), the first truly transparent, candidate-centric recruiting marketplace. My job is to make sure New York City has enough great talent and great companies connecting on the platform every day.

> Before Hired I worked at betaworks, where I created my role as Evangelist, a mix of product, community and recruiting across the betaworks network.

> Before betaworks I was a student at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, a small school within NYU in New York City. I studied technological disruptions (the history, philosophy and impact of technology's rapid progression on business and society) with a minor in Web Development. During college I also learned the startup, editorial, and internet ropes at Techstars, Coursekit, Contently, Savored and Terrible Labs, and NYLON Magazine.

I want to help people discover and acquire their dream jobs by harnessing the power of the internet.

Right now, I'm focused on improving this experience in the space I know best: the tech industry.

Someday, I'd like to apply the lessons i'm learning now to help every person connected to the internet.
